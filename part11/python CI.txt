# CI alternatives

- Drone CI: Drone CI is an open-source CI/CD tool that is easy to install and use. It supports most programming languages, and the configuration is done using a simple YAML file. Drone CI can be self-hosted or used as a cloud-based service.
- Travis CI: A continuous integration and testing CI/CD tool. It is free of cost for open source projects and provides seamless integration with GitHub. Travis CI supports more than 20 languages, like Node.js, PHP, Python, etc. along with Docker. You can easily customize the build environment as per your requirements.

# Self-hosted vs. Cloud-based

Cost: Self-hosted environments can be expensive to set up and maintain. On the other hand, cloud-based environments can be cheaper, but the costs can quickly add up as your usage increases.
Scalability: Cloud-based environments can be more scalable than self-hosted environments. Cloud-based environments can quickly spin up new resources to handle increased traffic or usage.
Security: Self-hosted environments can provide more control over security than cloud-based environments. However, cloud-based environments have improved their security measures considerably in recent years and can be just as secure as self-hosted environments.
